# Personal Blog

Tracking my journey as a developer, one project at a time.

This blog is my corner of the internet — built from scratch to track my coding journey, document projects, and share what I learn along the way.

## What It Does

- Users can read blog posts and post comments (if logged in).
- Admin (me) can create, update, and delete posts.
- Fully functional authentication using JWT and Flask sessions.
- Comments are linked to posts and display usernames and timestamps.
- Responsive layout and minimal clean design.

## Why I Built This

This project started as a way to learn and practice full-stack development — but it turned into something much bigger.

Over the past 3+ weeks, I went through the full process:
- Designing the database schema
- Building the backend with Flask
- Managing sessions and user authentication
- Creating templates with Jinja2
- Handling migrations with Flask-Migrate
- Deploying to the web using Docker and Render

This isn’t just a to-do app clone. This is a real, custom platform that does exactly what I need — and I built it all myself.

## What's Next?

I'll be using this blog to:
- Document new projects I build
- Reflect on what I’m learning
- Test new features like markdown rendering or image uploads

If you're an employer, dev, or recruiter: this isn’t just a static site — it’s an evolving showcase of my growth.
